Tired of wasting precious time deciding what to wear every morning? ðŸ•’ðŸ˜© Say hello to **Outfit Orchestrator**, a project that combines data engineering and fashion! Using Apache Airflow, we orchestrate the perfect outfit recommendation based on:  

- ðŸŒ¦ **Weather Data:** Don't let the rain catch you off guard!  
- ðŸ“… **Calendar Events:** Dress for every occasion.  
- ðŸ‘• **Wardrobe Inventory:** Make the most of what you own.  
- ðŸ“Š **Outfit History:** Avoid repeating looks too often.

## ðŸ“– How It Works  

### DAG Overview  
The Airflow DAG is the backbone of this project, orchestrating tasks step by step:  

1. **ðŸ§º Load Wardrobe Inventory:**  
   Fetch data about your available clothes from a CSV file.  

2. **ðŸ“– Check Outfit History:**  
   Look back at previously worn combinations to avoid repeats.  

3. **ðŸ“… Fetch Calendar Events:**  
   Connect to your Google Calendar and retrieve today's activities.  

4. **ðŸŒ¦ Fetch Weather Data:**  
   Get hourly weather forecasts to plan your outfit accordingly.  

5. **ðŸ‘— Generate Outfit Recommendation:**  
   Combine all the data to pick the perfect outfit for the day!  

6. **ðŸ“Š Calculate Usage Statistics:**  
   Analyze which items are most frequently used and save the results to `statistics.json`.

## ðŸ“ˆ DAG Graph  

Here's a visual overview of the DAG:  

```
    [Inventory] --> [History] --> [Calendar] --> [Weather]
                            \                 /
                             --> [Recommendation] --> [Statistics]
```  

Each node corresponds to a specific task, making the entire workflow modular, intuitive, and reusable.
